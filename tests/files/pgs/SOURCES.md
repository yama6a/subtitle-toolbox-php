Real `.sup` files hold bitmaps of film dialogue, so all files here are written for this repository. The `shapes` files show simple shapes. `text_1080p.sup` shows text that is written for this repository.

`generator/PgsFixtures.php` builds the files with `generator/PgsFixtureWriter.php`, which writes PGS segments and their run-length encoding. Run `php tests/files/pgs/generator/generate.php` to write them again. `PgsParserTest` checks that the files match the generator output.

| File | Source | License |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| `shapes_1080p.sup` | Written for this repository. 1920x1080, six cues: one object, two objects in two windows, a forced object split over several object segments, a palette update, a cropped object with an acquisition point and a segment of unknown type, and a last cue without a clearing display set | MIT |
| `shapes_576p.sup` | Written for this repository. 720x576, two cues, for the BT.601 colour matrix | MIT |
| `text_1080p.sup` | Written for this repository. 1920x1080, 12 cues of 1 or 2 lines in Liberation Sans, 44 to 60 px, with a black outline and 16 levels of anti-aliasing. Yellow and italic text, and one cue at the top. `TEXT_CUES` in `generator/PgsFixtures.php` holds the text. See [../ocr/SOURCES.md](../ocr/SOURCES.md) for the font and the renderer | MIT |
| `text_cyrillic_1080p.sup` | Written for this repository. The cues of `text_1080p.sup` in Russian, drawn the same way. `CYRILLIC_CUES` in `generator/PgsFixtures.php` holds the text | MIT |
| `authoring_layout_1080p.sup` | Written for this repository in the segment layout of a Blu-ray authoring tool: every display set is an epoch start (composition state `0x80`), also the one that clears the screen, and every palette defines all 256 entries. 1920x1080, three cues: a line of blocks, a bar that uses each of the 256 entries, and the text `Gate 12 closes at 9:40.` drawn as in `text_1080p.sup` | MIT |
| `fade_layout_1080p.sup` | Written for this repository in the segment layout of BDSup2Sub and SUPer: two objects in one composition, windows larger than the objects, and a fade out of 3 display sets in the normal state that only update the palette. 1920x1080, two cues of two lines of blocks | MIT |
| `expected/*.sup.json` | The pixel golden of each `.sup` file: the times, position, size, forced flag, alignment and the SHA-256 of the RGBA bytes of each cue. `php tests/files/generate-image-goldens.php` writes them with the library. Review each diff before a commit | MIT |
| `expected/*.sup.png` | The PNG of the first cue of each `.sup` file, for a reviewer to look at | MIT |
| `text_1080p.ocr.srt` | The text that `GlyphOcrEngine` reads from `text_1080p.sup` with its default database, the subtitle fonts database of php-glyph-ocr | MIT |
