No permissive real PAC files are known. The script writes each file in the shape that the PAC code of Subtitle Edit reads and writes, with the character bytes of its code tables, see THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.

Regenerate the self-written files with `php tests/files/pac/generate-fixtures.php`. The script writes every byte itself and does not use the library.
